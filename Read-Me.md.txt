Title: Homework Assignment.Wk One

ReadMe: This project was an opportunity to examine my personal skillset regarding semantics, structuring of .CSS and .HTML files, and ability to work through debugging when altering the structure of the .CSS and .HTML files. It was built on the basis of problem-solving and stamina, inviting the developer (myself) to see how they can push themselves and experiment with what works and does not. As developers, especially young developers, we exist in a constant state of learning and exploration to see how we can refine and grow our skills. Of course, this is not an easy task, be that a classroom assignment or a project at work. This project works to address the semantics that it came with, address the usability of future developers; as well as address the lack of accessibility and inclusivity available to those who need alternative captioning and methods of accessing information. I learned and was continually reminded of the value of accessibility, just because we may not personally use it does not mean someone else won’t need to. Something I am continually reminded of is that as developers, we are always learning and refining our craft and skill; there is no “arrival” or “end point” when it comes to knowledge and application of said knowledge. What makes my project stand out is the tenacity and grit that it took as I continually toyed with and applied code. Another factor that makes my project different is the implementation of diverse descriptions vs “image of dog”.
